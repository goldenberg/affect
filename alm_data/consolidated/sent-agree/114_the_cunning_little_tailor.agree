24@2@"Eh!" thought he, "what a stupid blockhead I am!
32@4@When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, "Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?"
40@2@Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, "Now wait until I come with the scissors," and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.
45@2@The bear in great fury ran after the carriage.
46@3@The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, "Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!"
50@4@The tailor drove quietly to church, and the princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark.
