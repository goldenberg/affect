0@6@FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it.
51@6@As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.
59@3@How the fir-tree trembled!
71@4@It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.
72@7@"Help! help!" exclaimed the young ladies, but there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire.
75@4@For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.
125@4@And then the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were ready to jump to the top of the tree.
138@4@"Now life is beginning again," said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air.
152@6@The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.
