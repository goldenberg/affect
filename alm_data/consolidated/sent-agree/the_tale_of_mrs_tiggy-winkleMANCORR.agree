2@6@One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!
26@3@A little frightened voice called out "Who's that?"
29@3@There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.
31@7@Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!
45@4@"Oh that IS lovely!" said Lucie.
73@4@And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
