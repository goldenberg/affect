5@4@"Yes, if I only knew a fresh one," said the old man, and nodded smilingly.
28@4@He was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here.
40@4@I tore it open and read it; I cried and laughed at the same time, and was so happy!
55@4@The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others."
63@4@She and the boy kissed each other, and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys.
