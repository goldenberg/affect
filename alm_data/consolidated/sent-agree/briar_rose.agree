1@6@Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed.
3@4@Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, "I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter."
4@4@What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land.
11@2@Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge.
12@2@So she cried out, "The king"s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead."
14@3@However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt.
36@4@She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
37@4@But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.
39@4@And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.
