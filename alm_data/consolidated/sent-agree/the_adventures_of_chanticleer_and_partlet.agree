3@4@"With all my heart," said Partlet, "let us go and make a holiday of it together."
8@2@While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, "You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds?
9@2@I"ll give it you well for your insolence!" and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily.
20@2@He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.
34@2@Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.
39@3@Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, "Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked."
45@6@Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet.
62@6@Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead.
